    <div id="about">
        My collection is a database of laptop covers of various people. Its contains covers from all ranges from colourful ones to retro themed ones, the range is exclusive and I have divided it into 10 sections. I think the way a laptop cover is decorated tells a lot about the kind of person one is and relates a lot to their personality as well.
